# Indexing text files
The application is simple.
It reads text files in the specified directory and creates a searchable Lucene index

NOTE: 

  - Used Lucene ver 7.4.0 for development. Older versions seem to have few of the functions depricated so the application is only compatible with Lucene 7.4.0
  - Compatible with Java Version 10 but should also work with older versions.
